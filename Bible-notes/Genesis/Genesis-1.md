## Genesis 1

### Pre genesis and the characteristics of God

Before he created the Earth, God existed eternally. He always has and always will exist - **“Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from ever-lasting to everlasting you are God”** *(Psalms 90:2)*. Additionally, God has no dependence on external factors yet by his own choice he brought something into existence - showing there's must be some devine purpose behind the action of creation.
God exists in three persons (God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit) - making up the holy trinity. This attribute of God however isn't explicitly mentioned in the Old Testenent because the prophets needed to speak of the uniquenes  of God  being uncreated and the only true God so as to lead the Israelites away from worshipping the false Gods of their neighbours. Note that the holy trinity is pointed at in the Old Testament and I will get to an example of this in analysing Genesis 1. 
The divine trinity had also planned redemption from the begining **"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world"** *(Ephesians 1:4)* , the death of Jesus on the cross was the plan all along, he would go to earth an die for the sins of the world. Salvation is a trinitarian act  - The son glorfies the Father (In his words spoken from the Father and actions instrcuted by the Father) and the  holy spirit glorifies the Son ( by empowering him). 

### notes on the book of Genesis itself

The first eleven chapters of Genesis are about four major events ( creation of Earth, the fall, the flood and the rebellion at Babel). After this, the book focuses souly on Israel  and also specifically on Four patriachs ( Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph). In the first 11 books, the human race act sinfully but there is hope with the introduction of Abraham and the covenant that is formed between him and God.  There is a cycle prevalent througout, wherein Humanity continues to sin against God yet God 
always grants them a second chance.	Ultimately, Despite all the failures, Gods devine will is acheived regardless - **“The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations”** *(Psalms 33:11)*.  Genesis lays out the foundations for the rest of the Bible story. God's promise of salvation is first mentioned in it *(Genesis 3:15)*.
